# Architecture

> Sangfor "senior field engineer" MCP monorepo: an AI that advises, plans, and (behind hard gates) executes Sangfor/FortiOS/Cisco device work — read-only by default, irreversible acts always human-signed.

pnpm workspace (`apps/*` + `packages/*`), run directly from TypeScript source via `tsx` (no build artifacts needed to run). Principle: **thin apps, fat packages** — apps are transport adapters; all domain logic lives in `packages/*`, rooted at the leaf `@sangfor/shared`.

## Domain map

- **Advisory & planning** — turn a project/requirement into a cited, risk-classified config plan; evaluate intended-vs-observed device state into PASS / FAIL / **INDETERMINATE** advisories.
- **Guarded execution** — the safety spine: risk classification, HMAC action-bound approvals, single-use nonces, read-back-verified apply, hash-chained audit ledgers. See [SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md).
- **Knowledge & learning** — local-first RAG over Sangfor manuals/KB/community, plus a feedback → lesson → wiki → evals → fine-tune loop.
- **Multi-vendor** — Sangfor (live REST + browser/CDP), FortiOS (REST), Cisco IOS-XE (RESTCONF/YANG) unified by one spec/evaluate engine.
- **Orchestration & ops** — device registry, run ledger, approval queue, and a playbook execution engine (Control Tower).

## Runtime topology

```
Cursor / MCP client ──stdio JSON-RPC──► apps/mcp-server        (77 sangfor.* tools; no port)
AIOSv2 portal ──HTTP──► apps/http-bridge (:3600) ──spawns──► apps/mcp-server (stdio)
apps/control-tower (:3700) ──HTTP──► http-bridge (:3600), mock-console (:3400)
apps/operator-console (:3502) ──in-process──► packages/* (no MCP hop)
apps/mock-sangfor-console (:3400)  = fake Sangfor/FortiOS/Cisco/OpenStack device
```

Apps import packages by **relative path** (`../../../packages/<pkg>/src/index.js`); packages import each other via the `@sangfor/*` / `@sangfor-engineer/*` tsconfig aliases.

## Dependency layering (the rule: imports point downward, never up)

```
L3 orchestration : verifier, product-adapters, screenshot, pptx  ── apps
L2 execution     : operator (→approval,chrome), planner (→approval,knowledge,rag,wiki)
L1 domain/data   : approval · safety · runs · evidence · config-state · hci-client · spec
                   version · sizing · rca · pm · store · integration · knowledge · rag
                   feedback · finetune · evals · wiki · competency · collector · chrome
L0 foundation    : @sangfor/shared   (leaf — no internal deps; everything imports it)
```

Enforced invariants of the graph: no L1 package imports an L2/L3 package; `operator` is pulled in only by `product-adapters`; `planner` only by `verifier`; `collector` receives `rag`/`finetune` by **dependency injection** (function params), not import. `shared` is the only universal dependency.

| `@sangfor-engineer/{fortios,cisco}-client` | L1 | vendor API JSON → normalized config-state (mapper-only) |

## Multi-vendor abstraction

Not an OO device interface — a **data contract + shared engine**. Each vendor ships a **spec** package (`IntendedSpec`, keyed by `observedKey` = *what to observe*) and a **client** package (pure functions: vendor API JSON → observed values). `@sangfor/spec.evaluateSpec(spec, observed)` is vendor-agnostic. Adding a vendor = spec + client + mock handler + MCP tool + spec data files, with **no engine change**. Transports differ: HCI = live REST (OpenStack/Keystone, the only mutation path), FortiOS = REST, Cisco = RESTCONF/YANG (both mapper-only), IAG/EPP/CC = browser/CDP. See [docs/MULTIVENDOR.md](docs/MULTIVENDOR.md).

## Execution & approval flow (the safety spine)

1. Every action defaults to **dry-run**; a non-dry-run live write must clear, in order: `SANGFOR_ALLOW_REAL_EXECUTION=true` → (production) `SANGFOR_ALLOW_PRODUCTION_EXECUTION=true` → a valid **HMAC action-bound approval** (`SANGFOR_OPERATOR_APPROVAL_SECRET` signs `approvedBy·changeTicketId·rollbackPlanId·nonce·expiresAt·action.type·action.target`) → **single-use nonce** consumed durably → origin-lock. Any missing piece **fails closed**. Central gate: `assertRealExecutionAllowed()` in `@sangfor/operator`.
2. Control Tower playbooks pause at a write block, mint a bridge approval on human approve, and resume (`continueFromApprove`). The HTTP bridge (`tool-guard.ts`) independently refuses destructive tools always and write tools on non-loopback binds without `SANGFOR_ALLOW_REMOTE_WRITE`.
3. Apply never trusts a 2xx — only a **PASS read-back** is success; INDETERMINATE ≠ PASS; failure **halts for a human** (no auto-rollback). Every step lands in a hash-chained audit ledger.

## Data flow (learning pipeline)

`collector` scrapes Sangfor KB + community → `data/sources/raw/*.md` + `manifest.json` → `rag.ingestDocument` chunks+embeds into the **local JSON vector index `data/rag/index.json`** → `ragSearch` cosine-ranks (+optional rerank) → runtime feedback → `feedback` lessons → `wiki` proposals (`pending_review`, token-gated) → `evals` safety-text checks → `finetune` JSONL datasets (`data/finetune/`) + job specs. Embeddings are local by default (`rapid-mlx` MLX server), with a deterministic `hash` fallback so ingest/search always work offline; cloud is gated by `SANGFOR_ALLOW_CLOUD_RAG`.

## Persistence

Primary state is **file-based** (see `data/`): RAG index, run ledgers (`data/runs/*.jsonl`), registry (`vendors.json` seed + gitignored `devices.json`), evidence/change-run ledgers, nonce store (`data/runtime/`). Postgres via Prisma (`@sangfor/store`) is an **optional bridge**, only active with `DATABASE_URL` + `SANGFOR_DB_ENABLED!=0`. Feedback/lessons/wiki proposals/eval cases are **persisted as file-based JSONL** (`@sangfor/shared` `appendJsonl`/`foldJsonlById`, roots configurable via `SANGFOR_FEEDBACK_ROOT`/`SANGFOR_EVALS_ROOT`/`SANGFOR_WIKI_ROOT`) — survives restart. Control-tower paused-block `originalArgs` remain intentionally in-memory only. Curated seeds under `data/` are committed; runtime artifacts are gitignored.
